## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Replace with your Google Sheet URL or Sheet ID
sheet_url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19SGRA-yeXmTxM-G24HiyQBAoXyvWJtzQyqeaI-i1C3M/edit?gid=0#gid=0"

# Read the entire sheet
df <- read_sheet(sheet_url)

# View data
# head(df)

timevis(df,width = "100%",
              options = list(
                format = htmlwidgets::JS("{ minorLabels: { minute: 'h:mma', hour: 'ha' }}")
              ))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
rmarkdown::render("README.Rmd")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
